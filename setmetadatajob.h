 * Sets mailbox metadata.
 *
 * Provides support for the IMAP METADATA extension; both the
 * final RFC version
 * (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5464">RFC 5464</a>)
 * and the older, incompatible draft version (known as ANNOTATEMORE)
 * (<a
 * href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-daboo-imap-annotatemore-07"
 * >draft-daboo-imap-annotatemore-07</a>).  See setServerCompatibility().
 *
 * Note that in Annotatemore mode, this job can only operate on
 * one metadata entry at once.
 *
 * This job can only be run when the session is in the
 * authenticated (or selected) state.
 *
 * If the server supports ACLs, the user will need the
 * Acl::Lookup right on the mailbox, as well as one of
 * - Acl::Read
 * - Acl::KeepSeen
 * - Acl::Write
 * - Acl::Insert
 * - Acl::Post
 * Otherwise, the user must be able to list the mailbox
 * and either read or write the message content.
 *
 * Note that even if the user has these permissions, the
 * server may refuse to allow the user to write metadata
 * based on some other criteria.
 *
 * Note also that on servers that implement the Annotatemore
 * version of the extension, only Acl::Lookup rights are
 * required (ie: the user must be able to list the mailbox).

     * The first part of the entry name should be "/private" or
     * "/shared", indicating the scope of the entry.  Note that
     * private metadata may not be supported by all servers.

     * Server metadata entry names include:
     * - /shared/comment

     * entry to the list of additions and updates that will be
     * performed on the metadata entry when the job is run.

     * @p name must be a valid UTF-8 string, and may not contain the
     * '%' or '*' characters, or NUL.  Use of non-visible UTF-8 characters
     * is strongly discouraged.
     *
     * Possible attribute name prefixes are:
     * - value - the data value of the attribute
     * - content-type - a MIME content type and subtype
     * - content-language - a RFC 3282 language code
     * - vendor.<vendor-token> - a vendor-specific attribute

     * Attribute names an attribute name prefix followed by ".priv" for
     * private attributes or ".shared" for shared attributes.  Note that

     * attributes set by the server, and so cannot be used with
