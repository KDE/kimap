 * and the older, incompatible draft version (known as ANNOTATEMORE)
 * (<a
 * href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-daboo-imap-annotatemore-07"
 * >draft-daboo-imap-annotatemore-07</a>).  See setServerCompatibility().
 *
 * This job can only be run when the session is in the
 * authenticated (or selected) state.
 *
 * If the server supports ACLs, the user will need the
 * Acl::Lookup right on the mailbox, as well as one of
 * - Acl::Read
 * - Acl::KeepSeen
 * - Acl::Write
 * - Acl::Insert
 * - Acl::Post
 * Otherwise, the user must be able to list the mailbox
 * and either read or write the message content.
 *
 * Note also that on servers that implement the Annotatemore
 * version of the extension, only Acl::Lookup rights are
 * required (ie: the user must be able to list the mailbox).
