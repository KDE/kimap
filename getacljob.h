 * Gets the ACL for a mailbox

 *
 * The user must have the Acl::Admin permission
 * on the mailbox for this job to succeed (see
 * MyRightsJob).
 *
 * This job requires that the server supports the ACL
 * capability, defined in
 * <a href="http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4314.html">RFC 4314</a>.
 *
 * The meaning of identifiers depends on the server implementation,
 * with the following restrictions:
 *
 * - "anyone" means any authenticated user, including anonymous
 * - an identifier starting with a minus sign ('-') indicates
 *   "negative rights": rights that should be taken away from
 *   matching users
 *
 * Other than the above restrictions, ACL identifiers are usually
 * IMAP usernames, but could potentially be group names as well.
 *
 * Note that negative rights override positive rights: if
 * "fred" and "-fred" are both assigned the 'w' right, the
 * user "fred" will not have the 'w' right.
