/**
 * Pretends to be an IMAP server for the purposes of unit tests.
 *
 * FakeServer does not really understand the IMAP protocol.  Instead,
 * you give it a script, or scenario, that lists how an IMAP session
 * exchange should go.  When it receives the client parts of the
 * scenario, it will respond with the following server parts.
 *
 * The server can be furnished with several scenarios.  The first
 * scenario will be played out to the first client that connects, the
 * second scenario to the second client connection and so on.
 *
 * The fake server runs as a separate thread in the same process it
 * is started from, and listens for connections on port 5989 on the
 * local machine.
 *
 * Scenarios are in the form of protocol messages, with a tag at the
 * start to indicate whether it is message that will be sent by the
 * client ("C:") or a response that should be sent by the server
 * ("S:").  For example:
 * @code
 * C: A000001 LIST "" *
 * S: * LIST ( \HasChildren ) / INBOX
 * S: * LIST ( \HasNoChildren ) / INBOX/&AOQ- &APY- &APw- @ &IKw-
 * S: * LIST ( \HasChildren ) / INBOX/lost+found
 * S: * LIST ( \HasNoChildren ) / "INBOX/lost+found/Calendar Public-20080128"
 * S: A000001 OK LIST completed
 * @endcode
 *
 * A line starting with X indicates that the connection should be
 * closed by the server.  This should be the last line in the
 * scenario.  For example, the following simulates the server closing
 * the connection after receiving too many bad commands:
 * @code
 * C: A000001 madhatter
 * S: A000001 BAD Command madhatter
 * X
 * @endcode
 *
 * FakeServer::preauth() and FakeServer::greeting() provide standard
 * PREAUTH and OK responses, respectively, that can be used (unmodified)
 * as the first line of a scenario.
 *
 * A typical usage is something like
 * @code
 * QList<QByteArray> scenario;
 * scenario << FakeServer::preauth()
 *          << "C: A000001 CAPABILITY"
 *          << "S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 STARTTLS AUTH=GSSAPI"
 *          << "S: A000001 OK CAPABILITY completed";
 *
 * FakeServer fakeServer;
 * fakeServer.setScenario( scenario );
 * fakeServer.start();
 *
 * KIMAP::Session session( "127.0.0.1", 5989 );
 * KIMAP::CapabilitiesJob *job = new KIMAP::CapabilitiesJob(&session);
 * QVERIFY( job->exec() );
 * // check the returned capabilities
 *
 * fakeServer.quit();
 * @endcode
