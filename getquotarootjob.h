 * Gets the quota root and resource limits for a mailbox.

 * Quotas are defined with respect to "resources" and "quota roots".
 * A resource is a numerical property that can be limited, such
 * as the octet size of all the messages in a mailbox, or the
 * number of messages in a mailbox.  Each mailbox has one or more
 * quota roots, which are where the resource limits are defined.
 * A quota root may or may not be a mailbox name, and an empty
 * string is a valid quota root.  All mailboxes with the same quota
 * root share the resource limits of the quota root.
 *
 * This job can only be run when the session is in the
 * authenticated (or selected) state.
 *
 * This job requires that the server supports the QUOTA
 * capability, defined in
 * <a href="http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2087.html">RFC 2087</a>.
